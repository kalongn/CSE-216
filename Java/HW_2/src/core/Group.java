/**
 * In algebra, a <b>group</b> is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements of the set to produce
 * a third element of the set, in such a way that the operation is associative, an identity element exists and every
 * element has an inverse. These three conditions, called <b>group axioms</b>, hold for number systems and many other
 * mathematical structures. For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group. The concept of
 * a group and its definition through the group axioms provides a unified abstract way of handling essential structural
 * properties of various types of entities (e.g., numbers, geometric shapes, and polynomial roots).
